    <string name="auto_brightness_help_text"><b>How is brightness calculated?</b>
\n\n
The brightness curve is calculated by performing a <i>cubic spline interpolation</i>
on a given number of <i>control points</i>. It\'s not a \'bucket-type\' calculation where
screen brightness will stay constant for a specific range of ambient brightness. That way,
small changes in ambient brightness do not cause a large jump in screen brightness; however,
it can be a little hard to predict the exact consequences of changing control points.\n
To help with that, a preview of the calculated curve can be examined. Please note that the
preview shows the curve in <i>logarithmic</i> scale, so that all control points can be shown
distinctively. When using a linear scale, it wouldn\'t be possible to distinguish the tendentially
more important control points in the lower range of ambient brightness.
\n\n
<b>How to edit the brightness curve?</b>
\n\n
Each line in the brightness list corresponds to one <i>control point</i> of the
brightness curve. To edit the brightness level of the point, you can use the slider
present in each line. The screen brightness will be changed accordingly while touching
the slider to give a preview of the light level.\n
Additional options are available by long-pressing a line. By selecting \'Edit\', you can
both edit the ambient brightness level of the control point as well as manually input the
desired screen brightness. Selecting \'Split\' allows you to to duplicate one line into
two in order to insert additional control points. \'Remove\' deletes the selected line.
